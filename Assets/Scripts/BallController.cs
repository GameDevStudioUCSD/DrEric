 * Description: A simple ball controller script. The idea is to have all 
 *              ball control scripting needs here. By our game's nature, Dr. 
 *              Eric can simply be thought of as a ball. Currently, this script
 *              only plays Dr. Eric's landing sound when he collides with a 2D
 *              object collider.
